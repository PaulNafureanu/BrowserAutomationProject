Install & Run WinAppDriver
1. Download the Windows Application Driver installer from https://github.com/Microsoft/WinAppDriver/releases
2. Run the installer on a Windows 10 machine where your application under test is installed and will be tested
3. Enable Developer Mode in Windows settings
4. Run WinAppDriver.exe from the installation directory (E.g. C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Application Driver)

Windows Application Driver will then be running on the test machine listening to requests on the default
IP address and port (127.0.0.1:4723).

Don't forget to set the path to the WinAppDriver in Environment Variables to make it possible to start winappdriver
from the command prompt window, otherwise, the winServer in the processes folder will crash.
